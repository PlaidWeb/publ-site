Welcome to the website for Publ, a flexible, lightweight system for website content management.

Publ is like a static site generator, but dynamic.

It is designed with the following principles in mind:

* Publish to the web simply by adding content files to your file system
* Rich support for adaptive templates that fit your content, not the other way around
* High-quality image renditions, including support for high-DPI ("Retina") displays
* Interoperate with other simple tools for an optimal [IndieWeb](http://indieweb.org) experience
* Allow fine-grained control over post privacy (both hidden/unlisted and login-required)

Want to know more? See [the FAQ](/faq).

This software (and this site!) is still in active development. While you're
here, maybe you'd like to check out the [documentation](/manual/) or the
[development blog](/blog/).

### Featured sites

Here are some sites using Publ as their CMS. If you would like your site to be
featured, please [email me](mailto:fluffy-AT-beesbuzz-DOT-biz?subject=A+Publ+site)
and I'll take a look.

* [busybee](https://beesbuzz.biz) â€” Contains very heterogenous content including photo galleries, webcomics, and blog-type content in varying presentations.
* [Mullins Molecular Retrovirology Lab](https://mullinslab.microbiol.washington.edu) -- An academic research lab which uses Publ to disseminate research materials
