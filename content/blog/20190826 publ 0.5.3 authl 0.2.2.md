I've released updates to both Publ and Authl.

On the Authl side:

* Code quality and documentation improvements
* Add an asynchronous client-side lookup thing that tells users how their login will proceed
* Add the redirection target to `disposition.Error` so that can be preserved correctly
* Update the Flask wrapper to use `disposition.Error.redir`
* Let the application know the redirection target in `render_login_func`

On the Publ side:

* If the site is configured to force HTTPS in authentication, force the cookie to be HTTPS-only
* If a user is already logged in, make the login handler redirect them to their destination

For both:

* Improved build scripts to make it less convenient to accidentally push a build from the wrong branch or version

These changes help to keep sites more secure from eavesdroppers, while also hopefully improving the user experience!
