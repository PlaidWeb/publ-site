Double-whammy release today.

.....

### Pushl changes

* Released the [previously-mentioned redirection fix](20191201 pushl 0.2.13.md)
* Added support for mf2 (`h-feed`/`h-entry`) feeds

Now all you "RSS is dead" folks have no excuse not to use Pushl. ðŸ˜˜

### Authl changes

* Backend improvements:
    * Renamed the Mastodon handler to Fediverse (since it turns out it supports Pleroma too!)
    * Enabled static analysis in the build process
* Flask frontend improvements:
    * Improved the login flow for people who are running without Javascript
    * Modernized the JavaScript in the login method probe, and made minor UX
        improvements there too (sorry to anyone who's still stuck on an
        [ancient browser](https://caniuse.com/#feat=async-functions), but at
        least login should still work!)
    * Improved error handling in the login flow; the singular error is passed
        along to the template (instead of using Flask message flashing),
        and the login form will be pre-filled with the last URL attempted.
