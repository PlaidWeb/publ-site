I just released v0.1.12 which adds a couple of quick, minor-ish fixes to Unicode handling; in particular:

* UTF-8-containing headers no longer get MIME-mangled on first import
* I finally made the automatic slug text way better by switching to [awesome-slugify](https://pypi.org/project/awesome-slugify/)

So, now it's no longer US-English-centric, at least. Right now it just uses the defaults; at some point I'll want to make it so that you can configure a site's or entry's language locale so that things work better on that end too.
