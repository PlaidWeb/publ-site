Pushl has been updated to be compatible with an API change made in Python 3.11, specifically fixing some functionality which was deprecated in Python 3.8 and which I somehow failed to notice the deprecation warning of.

Thanks to @seirdy for [bringing this to my attention](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl/issues/49).
