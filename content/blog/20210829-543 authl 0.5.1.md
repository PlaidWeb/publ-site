I've just released v0.5.1 of [Authl](https://authl.readthedocs.io/). The only functional change is adding support for actually parsing IndieAuth server response profiles (rather than just requesting one and only using the `h-card`), now that there's [implementations in the wild](https://blog.reiterate.app/software/2021/08/10/authorio-0-8-3-released/), meaning that egg has hatched into a chicken.

There were also some minor documentation cleanups since v0.5.0.
