Normally I wouldn't release a new version just for [a single minor bugfix](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/pull/253), but this was causing [bigger problems](https://github.com/rubys/feedvalidator/issues/38). Oops.

Anyway, there was one other [minor fix](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/commit/faae1ba7273002a79284af97579c7c257e080c4c), which allows "cb" to be a valid category name again. It's minor and fiddly but hey, consistency, right? (And anyway you never know, someone might use Publ for a site that has a [CB enthusiasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio) blog!)

.....

(That's the only meaning of CB, right?)
