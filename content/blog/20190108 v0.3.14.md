Version 0.3.14 of Publ is [now released](https://pypi.org/project/Publ/0.3.14/)!

This update is mostly about image stuff:

* Fixed a subtle caching bug that affects sites accessible from multiple URLs
* Fixed the way that size-clamping (`max_width` et al) work on remote and static images
* Enable JPEG optimization in the image renderer
* Add the ability to link to local rendered images in a Markdown link

Also, if you're using Publ and hosting your repository on GitHub you may have gotten a security warning regarding the version of pyyaml that Publ depends on. Don't worry, Publ doesn't actually use the vulnerable code (it's actually pulled in by one of the utility scripts from the watchdog library, and not used by watchdog itself). Watchdog has an [open issue about this](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog/issues/297) and they're on track to fix it Real Soon Now.

In the future Publ may actually pull in pyyaml itself for the friends-only functionality, but when it does you can be sure it'll be a current version. :)
