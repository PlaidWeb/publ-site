I just released Pushl v0.1.3, which adds some minor performance optimizations and a bug fix.

Originally I was hoping to have a *major* performance optimization, in the form of having rewritten Pushl from thread-per-connection to async operation, but unfortunately I ran into a bunch of problems with it. Mostly that I was running into a "too many open files" error and I couldn't figure out what was causing a descriptor leak. I have the [work-in-progress branch](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl/tree/aiohttp) online if anyone wants to take a look at it.

Anyway, the reason I went down *this* route is because I added WebSub subscriber support to [my fork of Feed-On-Feeds](http://github.com/fluffy-critter/Feed-On-Feeds), which makes it so that WebSub-enabled RSS and Atom feeds will push their updates to your reader instead of having to wait for a polling interval.

You can read more about some of my other thoughts on a [blog entry that quickly devolves into a rant](http://beesbuzz.biz/8139), if you're so inclined.
