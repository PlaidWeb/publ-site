Some pretty big new features added. First, in Authl:

* Major [documentation](https://authl.readthedocs.io) improvements
* Bug fixes with Fediverse instance caching
* All providers now normalize to the same profile format
* Some basic spam prevention for the email provider
* 100% unit test coverage on the Fediverse provider (which is now using [mastodon.py](https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py) instead of a hand-rolled OAuth client)

And in Publ:

* Fenced code now uses `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` instead of ad-hoc `<div>`s for its layout, and the overall HTML semantic has been greatly improved
* Individual code blocks are now configurable with respect to highlighting and line numbering
* The [user object](/api/user) now provides a user profile and separates the identity URL from the familiar name

.....

Currently I am getting quite frustrated with the state of this documentation site. I am working towards making Publ itself more amenable to documentation via pydoc/readthedocs, and transitioning this site only to be for demos and usage examples. I'm not sure how to make the templating guide and markdown extensions fit in with RTD, though.

I've [long wanted](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/issues/58) to do some sort of automated documentation generation, though, and as the various mechanisms in Publ get more complicated this starts to feel way more important. This is definitely something I could use some help on, for anyone who's interested.

It's also becoming more and more apparent that there needs to be some sort of online post editor, and I really ought to get around to building the simple one I've had in mind for a while. This is long-overdue.

Anyway. This update is a lot of fun. See [some of the stuff you can do with it](https://beesbuzz.biz/11695)!
