I've released [Authl](https://pypi.org/project/Authl) 0.1.1, which adds support for Mastodon authentication. And the Publ test suite now is up-to-date with that as well.

There's a few things I want to do on Publ before I release a version for use on my own website, the big one being the ability to provide a better login page, and some refactoring around built-in templates now that built-in templates are becoming a thing.

I also *really* want to redo how I manage the documentation site, because it's getting kind of untenable at this point.

Anyway, really soon I'll have properly-private content on my website again, and hopefully this will be enough of a feature for people to actually be interested in Publ!
