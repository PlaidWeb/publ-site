Some fresh new versions of things.

## Publ

Changes to Publ:

* Massive improvements to how footnotes are handled; now they get their [own virtual section](115#footnotes) (so if you're currently using footnotes you'll need to update your templates!)[^footnotes]
* Various performance improvements:
    * Some internal caching on image rendition stuff
    * Reduce contention in the content indexer (to hopefully make [large sites](https://beesbuzz.biz/) more responsive on restart)
    * Minor optimizations to `category.subcats`
* Removed `config.secret_key`; now this should be configured on the application object per Flask standards
* Allow HTML attributes other than `href` and `src` to contain [image renditions](322#rendition-attrs)

[^footnotes]: Seriously, you're going to need to fix some stuff, but it's worth it.

## Authl

* Improve [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net/) support
* Improve the JavaScript in the default Flask template

Also, I have some [newer thoughts on ActivityPub support](https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/4379-Im-warming-up-to-ActivityPub).
