Today I added two new useful features:

* [template overrides](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/pull/96) (including private templates)
* [hierarchy breadcrumbs](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/pull/95)

I also implemented the [better date sort](https://github.com/fluffy-
critter/Publ/issues/91) mentioned [previously](398).

These things are already making my new personal site look way better and easier
to use! I feel like I'm almost ready to flip the switch.
