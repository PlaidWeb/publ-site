Not a lot to say, just that ~~[all my intended image rendition functions work now](336)~~ (historical note: this entry was back when the Publ site included the test suite, which is [no longer the case](332)).

I really need to stop dragging my feet on migrating beesbuzz.biz over, because there is
absolutely no excuse now.

Anyway, this ups the Publ version to 0.1.5. Have fun.
