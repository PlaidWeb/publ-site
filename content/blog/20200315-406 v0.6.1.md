This is a new version of Publ. The main change is how deletions (using `~~markdown~~` and `<del>HTML</del> <s>tags</s>`) get converted to plaintext --- namely they get removed, to make it make more visible sense.

Doing this also led to refactoring the internal `strip_html` function to provide a bit more flexibility, so now it's now available as a [Jinja2 template filter](324#strip_html).

I also removed a couple of troublesome micro-optimizations that were causing more trouble than they were worth.
