Two major updates for v0.1.13:

* Rewrote the pagination logic to actually work across category-recursive views, and to support pagination where the
    sort order isn't necessarily the same between renders
* Refactored images so that the template `image()` function has access to the tag writer

These changes were made as part of migrating beesbuzz.biz over to Publ, which I've made a lot of progress on now.
It's pretty nice getting my overall design proven out, and to shake out all the little bugs and misfeatures.

Hopefully soon I'll have Publ in a state where I feel comfortable releasing it as beta.
