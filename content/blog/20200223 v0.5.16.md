Today I released Publ v0.5.16, since it has a few features I wanted to deploy on my own sites:

* [Path aliases](322#path-alias) can now be set to be an alternate "mount point" or to override the canonical entry path ([for example](//beesbuzz.biz/about))
* View tags can now be [filtered](150#tag_filter) to show entries with any, all, or none of the requested tags
* As a consequence of the above, category tag lists can also be used as a progressive refinement (see, for example, [on this blog](/blog/))
