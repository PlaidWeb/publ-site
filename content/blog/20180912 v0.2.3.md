Earlier today I pushed v0.2.2, which was a minor configuration fix for the markdown library to support table syntax.

Then I pushed v0.2.2.1 which was another configuration fix to fix that fix (oops).

Then in deploying updates I upgraded to Python 3.7, and promptly discovered that Publ doesn't actually work on Python 3.7, so just now I fixed that, and released the fixes as v0.2.3.
