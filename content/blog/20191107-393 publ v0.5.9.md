Publ v0.5.9 is now out. Just a couple of bugfixes in this one:

* Login pages now properly redirect to https again (after that was broken due to some of the recent auth-related changes)
* `view.range` works correctly again, as does everything else that relied on `len()` on parameter-optional properties (e.g. `view.count`)
