I've gotten [Pushl](http://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl) to the point that I'm confident in releasing it as a full alpha and having a cron job run it every 15 minutes. Whew.

I've also added some `h-entry` markup to the [Publ site templates](http://github.com/PlaidWeb/publ-site) so that hopefully the notifications appear at least somewhat reasonably elsewhere.

I really need to redo these site templates now that I have a better idea of how they go together. Also the [quickstart guide](/getting-started) could be a *lot* better.
