I finally got around to releasing a very rough prototype of [Pushl](http://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl) to pypi. It only sends out WebSub notifications for now (does anyone even use those?), but I'll work on actually implementing WebMention soon.

Also, recently someone pointed out to me [fed.brid.gy](https://fed.brid.gy) which makes it easy to turn a static site into an ActivityPub source. At some point I'll experiment with setting up Publ for this; it looks like it's just a matter of adding a couple of additional route rules to Publ, so that will probably go into an advanced configuration guide if I ever get around to making such a thing. (Or it could actually be added to Publ directly but there isn't much of a reason for that, IMO.)
