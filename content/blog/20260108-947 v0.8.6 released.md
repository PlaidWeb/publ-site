Publ v0.8.6 is out; in this release I just added a better default token store for [authentication](865#auth), which will now work correctly in a multiprocess configuration (as opposed to the old default which would work with multiple threads but not multiple processes).

I've also finally documented how to provide your own token store for more exotic configurations, although that, much like Sam Reich, has been here the whole time.
