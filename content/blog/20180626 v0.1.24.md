New functionality:

* The image rendition cache now gets periodically purged; the default is to delete renditions which haven't been used in the last week (this can be disabled)

Bug fixes:

* `entry.title` can now accept the `no_smartquotes` parameter, which is necessary in Atom feeds
* `entry.card` now uses the same Markdown extensions as `entry.body`
