Today marks the release of Publ v0.7.17. Aside from the usual upstream-dependency changes and progressive delinting, this release fixes a subtle but annoying issue with how `View.link` works. There's a [longer description of the issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/issues/506) but the upshot of this is that now the parameters passed into a `View` object get properly validated, meaning that if you're doing something like:

```html
<a href="{{view.previous(template='bob')}}>">
```

this will fail, as the correct syntax is (and always has been)

```html
<a href="{{view.previous.link(template='bob')}}>">
```
