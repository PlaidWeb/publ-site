I've released v0.2.8 of Pushl, which fixes an issue with Webmention and Pingback where it was over-optimistically setting the link target. It will also warn you if the link target doesn't match with the actual page, so you can update your links accordingly.

Right now it's a *little* spammy (in that it'll tell you about redirection mismatches for all links, not just ones with a Webmention or Pingback endpoint), but the next version will address that.
