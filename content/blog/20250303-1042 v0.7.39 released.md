There's been several minor releases of Publ, and it's up to v0.7.39 now. Here's what's changed since v0.7.35:

* Fixed a bug with CSS templates erroneously entity-escaping quotes
* `entry.archive()` now elides the template-name if it's the category default (matching `view.link()`)
* Internal type-safety changes for the latest version of BeautifulSoup
* Add [`Status: ATTACHMENT`](322#status)
* Removed the background image rendering threadpool, as it was an artifact of an early design that ended up not being beneficial for real-world operation
* (Hopefully) fixed an issue with the indexer ignoring attachments that have not yet been indexed
* Fixed an issue with the permission error handling on the admin dashboard

The only user-facing change is the `Status: ATTACHMENT` thing.
