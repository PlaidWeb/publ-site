Howdy y'all! Here's a new release of Publ for you.

What's new in this version:

* Add the ability to filter by multiple categories, and also to filter *out* categories as well
* Various code cleanups, especially around the query generator

Also the unannounced v0.5.4 release was to fix some stuff that broke due to an upstream [Arrow](https://arrow.readthedocs.io) change (specifically dealing with them removing an API that I was using to suppress warnings for a different upstream change that I'd already handled).

I should also mention that I've [updated the beesbuzz.biz template samples](https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/3982-Some-template-changes) to improve IndieWeb and ActivityPub compatibility. (Publ still doesn't support ActivityPub itself but these changes make it interoperate with [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy) a bit better.)

On a meta note, I've left the [microbiology lab](https://mullinslab.microbiol.washington.edu/) I was at; I hope they continue to use Publ, of course! Over the next little while I'm going to spend some more time working on my own things again (including Publ et al), but I've also had some interesting job interviews with one of them seeming very likely to turn into an offer. Wish me luck, if you're into that sort of thing! (And of course, follow [my blog](https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/) for the primary source of this stuff.)
