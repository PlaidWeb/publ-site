It's been a while since I've updated [Pushl](http://pypi.org/project/Pushl) but today I released v0.1.6. It includes the following fixes:

* Now it supports Pingback as well as Webmention
* Improved the threading defaults and connection pooling
* Also checks entries for updates even if the feed didn't change (in case something changed in the more text or page metadata or whatever)

Anyway, it should just be a `pip install --upgrade pushl` (or `pipenv update`) away.
