I've just released v0.8.0 of Publ, which is a minor version change because this has the potential of changing the URL scheme in some cases.

This is also the first release announcement since v0.7.40, so here's what's changed since then:

* Fixed a bug with render arguments not being passed in correctly for card images
* Improved the mechanism for adding fallback images to a card
* Support Unicode characters (and internal periods, as seen on this very entry!) in URLs and tags

Note that any affected URLs for existing entries may not change until the site has been fully reindexed. If this matters to you, run `flask publ reindex -f`.
