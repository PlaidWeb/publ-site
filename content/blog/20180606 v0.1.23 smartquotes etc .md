I neglected to mention that I set Publ to beta status in v0.1.22, which was a minor bugfix release, rather than moving to 0.2 like I previously stated. The changes for 0.1.22 were:

* Fixes to category `Sort-Name`
* Added support for regex path-alias hooks (this is configured on the [Python/WSGI side](/api/python), and has been working quite nicely over on [beesbuzz.biz](https://beesbuzz.biz/))
* Fixed a dumb bug in the cache-control headers

And then the changes for 0.1.23:

* Enable automatic smart-quote substitutions (this is the default setting, and can be overridden by passing `no_smartquotes=True` to `entry.body`/`entry.more`/`entry.title`)
* Improve the handling of last-modified times on entries (now there's a `Last-Modified` header which only gets set when you want it to be)
