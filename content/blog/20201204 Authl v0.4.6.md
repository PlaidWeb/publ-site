Wow, it's been a while since I've worked on this stuff, huh?

Anyway, IndieAuth validation rules [have changed for the better](https://aaronparecki.com/2020/12/03/1/indieauth-2020), so Authl has been updated accordingly.

There's a few other changes as well:

* On IndieAuth profiles, `p-pronoun` is treated as a fallback for `p-pronouns`
* The Flask templates add some `rel="nofollow"` in some appropriate places
