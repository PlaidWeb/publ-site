I found a few more annoying bugs that were shaken out from the whole PonyORM transition, as well as a couple of bugs in the new [shape functionality](660). There's probably a few more of these bugs lurking in the codebase (I mean, in addition to the [existing bugs I know about](http://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/issues)), but here's what's changed:

* Image shape bugs:
    * Fix some `FileNotFound` handling on images (so `shape` errors propagate correctly)
    * Make `img_class` and `class` work correctly per the documentation
* PonyORM bugs:
    * Put pessimistic lock around all get-or-creates, (hopefully fixing) [a transitory indexing error](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/issues/126)
    * Fix an error where [incomplete category paths weren't forwarding correctly](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/issues/127)

.....

That last one is something where there's probably a few other lurking similar things in the codebase; peewee allows you to check for the existence of any matching record with:

```python
record = ModelClass.get(key=value)
if record:
    # a record exists
```

which happens to also be a valid expression in PonyORM (one of the few places where they have API in common), *but* PonyORM only lets you use `get` to retrieve a single value. In PonyORM you instead have to do something a bit different to see if *any* item matches; for example, this is what Publ does now:

```python
if pony.orm.select(e for e in ModelClass if e.key == value).exists():
    # a record exists
```

which happens to be somewhat more efficient (although it's basically a micro-optimization).

I suppose I should simply audit all uses of `.get()` since *most* of them are for single-item lookups but there's probably a few places where I'm using it as a rough `.exists()` equivalent, which was never really great anyway.
