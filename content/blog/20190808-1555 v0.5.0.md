I figured there wasn't really any reason to keep waiting. So here we are.

Changes since v0.4.6:

* Improve the performance and stability of the admin dashboard
* Correctly fall back to the internal Authl templates
* Remove some spurious/empty attributes from image tags
* Don't cache template mappings forever
* Don't mark an entry title as being markup if its markup is disabled
* Correctly set the default entry recursion for `entry.previous`/`next`
* Disable an arrow warning for a future change

In other news, over on [my main website](https://beesbuzz.biz/) I have successfully migrated my comments over to [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/), which is a nice self-hosted alternative to Disqus that does a much better job of handling privacy in particular, as well as providing a simpler UX that doesn't try to get in your face about everything. If you want to read more about how I made that change, read the several blog entries starting with "[Moving away from Disqus](http://beesbuzz.biz/blog/1768-Moving-away-from-Disqus)," and also look at the [sample templates](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ-templates-beesbuzz.biz) to see the actual implementation.

May your private entries remain exclusive, and your public entries be brilliant.

==UPDATE:== Someday I'll learn to use and test rc builds before making an actual public release. Oops.
