Publ 0.6.9 is out and has the following changes:

* Removed the vestigial attempt at supporting AutoAuth
* `Path-alias` now works for all URL paths, and not just ones which happened to match Publ's routing rules
* Fixed a bug in formatted code blocks that was generating extra newlines per line
* Added [user bearer token generation](733#token) to the public API
* Changing a user's permissions now correctly invalidates their rendition cache


==Important:== If you were using the `token_endpoint` function, that has been removed, along with the token endpoint itself.

.....

This actually mostly completes the work I had in mind for v0.7.0, but there's still a notable lack of automated unit testing.

Also, this website really needs to be properly redone; Publ is at a point where this ad-hoc infodump doesn't properly represent what Publ is capable of. I have some ideas in mind, but currently not enough time to implement those ideas. Hopefully that will be changing soon.
