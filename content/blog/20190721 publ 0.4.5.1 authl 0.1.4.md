I've released a mini-update of Publ to fix an authentication problem (the config parser was "helpfully" sanitizing things that didn't want to be sanitized), and also some refactoring/improvements/bugfixes to Authl.

The big changes to Authl are that the email handler generates shorter/nicer links, and it also puts an anti-abuse timeout into email login attempts to prevent people from spamming themselves or others with spurious email notifications. There's also a bunch of small bugfixes to Authl's login flow, and Flask apps can specify that sessions should *not* be made permanent.
