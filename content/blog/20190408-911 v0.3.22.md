I've now released Publ v0.3.22, which is mostly a bugfix release but also adds a couple of useful things. Major changes:

* Entries which are set to status `DRAFT` or `GONE` no longer function as path-alias redirections
* `category` now has [`tags`](170#tags), allowing templates to build in tag browsing
* Similarly, `view` now has [tag refinements](150#tags), making it easier to modify views' tag restrictions
* Fixed a [silly bug](/issue/188) which was causing top-level categories to not redirect without a trailing `/`
* Also did a bunch of refactoring on image handling, with no functionality change but it makes the code easier to navigate (I hope)

Oh and I guess I forgot to post a release announcement of v0.3.21 back on April 2, oops! There were some pretty major fixes to that:

* Somehow the `<img alt>` attribute got turned to `<img alt_text>`, which is not valid. That has been fixed. (I suspect I was really tired when I was reorganizing some code.)
* JPEGs now correctly support EXIF orientations/rotations
* Added support for [`entry.summary`](115#summary), as well as [overriding the summary text](322#summary) on an entry..

Also, how did I miss that v0.3.21's release was on the first anniversary of [my first functioning blog post](325)?! Wow, time flies.
