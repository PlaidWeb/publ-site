I've released v0.3.7, which just fixes a few issues around transaction management and overall indexing performance. Namely:

* The indexer locks individual entries as it's working on them
* If an entry is being worked on, watchdog will ignore it
* Cleaned up a couple of transaction failures that can occur due to PonyORM's optimistic locking behavior
