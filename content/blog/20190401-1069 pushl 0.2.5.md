I have released v0.2.5 of Pushl. The changes since v0.2.4:

* Improved the logging levels a bunch, making them more useful
* Added the ability to only send WebSub for feeds

The latter improvement makes it so that if your site is accessible from multiple URLs (e.g. `http` and `https`, or multiple domain names), it won't send multiple Webmentions to everyone with each possible URL. This helps to cut down on spamminess to sites which don't detect multi-origin pings (such as most IndieWeb blogs or [fed.brid.gy](https://fed.brid.gy)).

I also finally added a [tools page](/tools/) to this website, to collect useful things that make Publ work better with other things. I also intend to add various useful quality-of-life things like an image cropping tool, and whatever else might occur to me down the road.

Someday I need to get around to making a proper "Features" page for this site, too. *Someday...*
