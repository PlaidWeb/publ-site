While I'm fixing random stuff in Publ, I figured I'd finally fix some problems with Pushl too. Nothing major here, just:

* Stability: Fixed a bug where feeds that don't declare links caused the worker to die before entries got processed
* Performance: Now we use a global connection pool (so connections can be reused)
* Fixed a [minor correctness issue](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl/issues/9) with archive feeds (which actually doesn't make any difference in the real world but whatever)
