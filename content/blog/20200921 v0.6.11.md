Just some cleanups and usability fixes:

* Raise a 400 error on malformed URLs with known handling instead of 500
* Don't include subcategories with no indexable entries (e.g. all `GONE`/`HIDDEN`/etc.)
* Improve the admin dashboard
* Miscellaneous code cleanups

Also I forgot to announce v0.6.10, released back on September 1; the changes from v0.6.9 were:

* Let `401 Unauthorized` status overcome a path alias
* Improve the tests
* Sort the "recent users" display on the admin dashboard
