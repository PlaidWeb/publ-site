I've been working on getting Pushl much more stable and reliable, particularly around a persistent "too many open files" error I was having, which turned out to be primarily due to a fd leak in the caching routines. Oops.

Anyway, there's also seemingly a problem with how `aiohttp` manages its connection pool, at least on macOS, so I've disabled connection keep-alive by default. However, if you still want to use keep-alive, there's now a `--keepalive` option to allow you to do that. I'm finding that it doesn't really improve performance all that much anyway.

This is feeling beta-ready but I'll give it a few days for other issues to shake out first.
