While trying to figure out some weird access patterns on the day-job site I had the realization Pushl wasn't actually specifying a user-agent, so it was just coming through as the generic `aiohttp` one, which isn't very friendly.

Now it sends a reasonable user-agent by default, and this can be overridden by the `--user-agent` flag if you want to for your own analytics or whatever.

Oh, and I had quietly released 0.2.3 a few days ago; there were just some minor internal changes to logging and also declaring Pushl as beta, rather than alpha, software.
