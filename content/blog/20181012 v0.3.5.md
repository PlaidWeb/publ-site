I've now released v0.3.5 of Publ. Changelog:

* Add support for listing deleted entries (accessible via [`view.deleted`](/api/view))
* Improved how the last-modified/etag reference was determined (also fixing a nasty bug where a site might crash if a file is deleted)
* Fixed a [minor shaping bug](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/issues/132)

I've also updated the [sample site templates](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ-sample-templates) with all of the changes that have happened since, uh, June, and also included some sample content so it's easier to get started with it.
