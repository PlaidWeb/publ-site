I've updated Authl to make it support the new-ish `profile` scope in Mastodon 4.3, which provides better login-flow UX.

If `profile` is unsupported it tries to fall back to the old `read:accounts` scope, which should keep it working on older Mastodon versions as well.

In theory it should also work with Pleroma/Akkoma (and anything else that speaks the Mastodon client API), although that functionality hasn't been verified in quite some time. If someone else wants to take on the work of verifying that and fixing whatever's broken, that would be greatly appreciated!
