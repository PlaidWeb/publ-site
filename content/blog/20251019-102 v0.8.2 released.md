Here's a new version of Publ. The only thing new about it is that I've completely rewritten the `Accept:` header mechanism to be much closer to what one would expect based on the HTTP standard, and also now you can [override MIME types on a per-template or per-extension basis](865#template_mimetypes).

... And of course with a major rewrite that I decided to push out after midnight after a very long day of coding, of *course* it had some edge-case bugs, right on the edge cases I was trying to fix to begin with. Whoops. Now we're on 0.8.3.
