Publ v0.7.3 is now out, with the following changes:

* Properly handles markdown and HTML stripping in summary text
* Improves first-paragraph extraction for OpenGraph cards
* Reduces unnecessary image renditions for OpenGraph cards
* Finally deprecates the `AUTHL_FORCE_SSL` configuration setting
* Adds group display to the user information on the admin panel
* Fix the PyPI listing
* Make the image rendition cache purge mechanism actually, you know, work

Note that [`entry.summary`](115#summary) now takes an optional parameter, `markup`, which defaults to `True`, for the sake of consistency with the rest of the Publ templating API. If you are using `entry.summary` to provide descriptive text for things (e.g. `<a title="{{entry.summary}}">` or `<meta name="description" content="{{entry.summary}}">`) this will have to change to `{{entry.summary(markup=False)}}`.

.....

It turns out the cache-purging bug has been there for 3 years, ever since [cache purging was implemented](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/commit/232df7cb470285d5d1640e36515c3f9f6ceb9c16). I guess I never actually tested that code and never noticed that there were stale image renditions hanging around. Whoops.

Anyway, fixing that bug immediately freed up over a gigabyte of space on my server.
