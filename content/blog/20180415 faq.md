I was just on a few days' business trip for my [augmented reality startup](http://workshop3d.com)
(we just released [a new app](http://workshop3d.com/propellar/), by the way! check it out, it's
free and fun) and so I haven't had time to work on Publ for a bit. But I've been getting a bunch
of questions about Publ, so I figured I should answer some of them!

EDIT: Moved this into [its own page on the main site](/faq).
