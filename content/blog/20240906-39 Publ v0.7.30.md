It's been a while since I've worked on Publ but I got an itch for some new features, so here we are.

Specifically, there are two super-useful changes:

* You can now [retrieve a specific entry from a template](324#get-entry) (by entry ID, not by path)
* Given an existing `entry`, `category`, or `template` object you can retrieve an image relative to their context, using [`entry.image`](115#func-image), [`category.image`](170#func-image) and [`template.image`](416#func-image), respectively
