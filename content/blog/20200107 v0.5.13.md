Progress being made, although not much of it has been in service of my intended v0.6 milestone.

Release notes:

* Applied the `smartquotes`/`no_smartquotes` API change to `entry.title`
* Consolidated and cleaned up OpenGraph card parsing to make it consistent across Markdown and HTML entries, and fixing a few Markdown-specific bugs
* Refactored the image rendition pipeline to make it more extensible/testable/clean (and also fixed a caching issue with palette quantization)
* Added the ability to select scaling algorithm on a per-image basis
* Cleaned up entry deletion and reindexing
* Improved the testing of `entry.auth`
* Removed a short-term performance hack on the authentication dashboard

Also, as of now, I run a live version of the [Publ integration tests](https://dev.beesbuzz.biz/), although it's currently only manually-updated.
