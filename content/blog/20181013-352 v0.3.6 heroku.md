I just released v0.3.6 of Publ, which just allows it to work with databases other than SQLite. In particular this is part of testing more advanced [heroku deployment](/heroku) options.

Right now I'm primarily focusing on improving the [documentation](/manual/), especially the [quickstart guide](/getting-started), since people are finally showing interest in Publ but aren't quite sure where to begin!
