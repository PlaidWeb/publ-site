Here's a new release of Publ.

Actually it looks like I've been remiss in announcing the last several releases, because each of them just had minor changes! So here's a bit of a catchup:

* v0.7.19: Pass through rendition arguments (including quality and format) to the fullsize rendition
* v0.7.20: Just a bunch of upstream dependency updates
* v0.7.21: Some shenanigans while trying to figure out how to deal with [Pony's incompatibility with Python 3.11](https://github.com/ponyorm/pony/issues/668), as yet unresolved
* v0.7.22:
    * Fixed an issue with some transparent images not being detected as transparent due to using uncommon formats (particularly grayscale-with-alpha PNGs in the `LA` pixel format)
    * Changed the way that the [authentication](706) key gets configured; this was necessary due to an [upstream change in Flask](/issue/500)

At present there appears to be an occasional issue with how watchdog works (or doesn't), and I haven't figured out the rhyme or reason. A pending Publ release will hopefully fix this. My apologies for the inconvenience.
