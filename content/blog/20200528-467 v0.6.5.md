Publ v0.6.5 is now out. Has the following changes:

* Upgrading Publ will now invalidate the cache
* Fixes the missing database session around the authentication log viewer
* Fixes the way that the indexer works when an entry changes ID
* Fixes a bug where draft entries' temporary IDs were overriding the permanent/assigned IDs of visible entries
* Added some [useful commandline tools](238)

The next things I want to work on:

* [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) endpoint (done as a separate component that you can optionally add)
* Adding more unit tests
* Maybe an actual (very basic) CMS UI? I dunno
