Pushl v0.3.0 is now out. Changes since v0.2.14:

* Some caching fixes
* Updates to some antiquated terminology

Per the above, the main code branch[^branch] is now called `main`, and you include and exclude link `rel` attributes with `--rel-include` and `--rel-exclude`, in keeping with some long-overdue naming convention updates.

We're all in this together.

[^branch]: I am also making this change on all of my other repositories as I come across them. Some are a bit more involved than others but if you come across one that's still using an outdated main branch name, feel free to open an issue to let me know!
