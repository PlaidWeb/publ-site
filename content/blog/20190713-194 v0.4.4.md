Title: v0.4.4, and private entries in the wild
Tag: release
Tag: authl
Date: 2019-07-13 17:25:31-07:00
Entry-ID: 194

I've added private entry stuff to [my website](http://beesbuzz.biz) (here's an [example post](https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/3922-Yay-post-privacy)) and in doing so I shook out a few loose ends:

* Improved the login flow for when someone is logged in but goes to an entry they don't have access to
* Simplified generating login and logout links from templates
* Added `Status: UNLISTED` as a synonym for `Status: HIDDEN`

All the auth-related things are now documented [here](/manual/) and also demonstrated in the [sample templates](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ-templates-beesbuzz.biz).

There is [not much left for v0.5](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.5), incidentally!
