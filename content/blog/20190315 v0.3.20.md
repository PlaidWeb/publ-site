Yep, it's another release. New stuff in this one:

* Changed cropping to be `(x,y,w,h)` (as [previously mentioned](232)) and also changed scale-cropping to be a single-pass operation
* Added [`Hidden-Tag`](322#hiddentag)
* Added a [`tags` property](150#tags) to view objects

Also, on an administrative note, if you would like to help fund the development of Publ, I have switched from Patreon to [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/PlaidWeb), which provides a bunch of advantages over Patreon and is much better-suited to open-source development.
