Wow, this is a pretty major update: [authentication](/manual/authentication.md) is now a thing!

It isn't quite complete yet -- I still have [a few more things](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A0.5) I want to add before I consider it done (and therefore release v0.5.0) -- but this is at least in a state where it's ready to be experimented with. Probably. I need to sleep first, before I start adding authentication to [my website](https://beesbuzz.biz).
