Title: v0.1.19: creeping ever closer to beta status
Date: 2018-05-27 17:22:23-07:00

The amount of stuff I'm having to fix in Publ to support [beesbuzz.biz](https://beesbuzz.biz/) is diminishing rapidly! Here's what's happened since 0.1.18:

* Improved the Path-Alias redirection logic; now it will do a `301 Permanently Moved` for inbound `Path-Alias`ed requests, and if a `Path-Alias` points to an entry with a `Redirect-To` it will redirect directly to that URL instead (and it will be a 302, same as the old `Redirect-To` behavior)
* Pagination can now be weekly; you can use `entry.archive(paging='week')`, and a `?date=` view parameter ending in `_w` will provide a weekly view instead.
* Better default formatting for `view.range`, and an addition of a `week` format parameter there

.....

What's left to do before I'm happy releasing this as beta?

### Release blockers
* [Cache should be disabled while index is taking place](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/issues/84)
* [Async image renditions don't respect `absolute` parameter](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/issues/106)

### Nice-to-haves
* [Enhanced path-alias](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/issues/11)
* [Add image cropping function](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/issues/77)

### Already done

A change I made right after cutting v0.1.19 was to restore the index scan at startup, but only when running in production (since the deferred scan was to fix a bug that only manifests in debug mode).
