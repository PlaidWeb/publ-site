I'd been running this website on Heroku's free tier for a while, but it's been getting enough traffic that it was getting close to my free runtime limit. So, I've moved this over to my own personal server.

However, the [site repository](/github-site) is still configured to work with Heroku (as well as being self-hosted), and you can still access the Heroku instance at [publ.herokuapp.com](http://publ.herokuapp.com/) to see it in action. They should, for the most part, mirror one another.

Anyway, there will probably be some kinks to iron out in the meantime. But on the plus side, it means this site will finally be accessible via https!
