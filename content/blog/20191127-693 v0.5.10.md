Publ v0.5.10 is [now available](https://pypi.org/project/Publ/0.5.10/). The following has changed since v0.5.9:

* Image sets will generate fullsize renditions (and their links) for images which were skipped, so they will still appear in the lightbox
* Footnotes now get rolled up into the `entry.more` (with some caveats), and also get stable permalinks for their references[^intro]
* You can now annotate an HTML attribute with `$` to force it to resolve as an asset (useful for certain JavaScript libraries); see the [relevant documentation](322#link-targets)

[^intro]: So now you can safely use footnotes in intro text.

I've also made a bunch of changes to the [sample templates](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ-templates-beesbuzz.biz/).

.....

Although in posting this entry I found a [bug](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/issues/316)[^bug] in the footnote rollup thing where now footnotes only appear at all if there's more-text.

[^bug]: Oops.
