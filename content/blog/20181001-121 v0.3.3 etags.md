I've started working on [Pushl](http://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl) in earnest now, and one thing that was really bugging me about this is that anything which polls feeds and entries would really benefit from having client-side cache control working. Which was a big missing feature in Publ.

Well, I finally implemented it, and I'm [pretty happy with how I did it](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/pull/130).

The short version: for any given view it figures out (pessimistically) what's the most recent file that would have affected the view (well, within reason; it only looks at the current template rather than any included templates, which is pretty difficult to do correctly) and uses that to generate an ETag (via metadata fingerprint) and a Last-Modified time (based either on the file modification time or the time the entry was actually published).

There's probably a few corner cases this misses but in general this makes client-side caching of feeds and such work nicely.
