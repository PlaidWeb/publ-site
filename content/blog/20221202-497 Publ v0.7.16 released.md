Minor release for Publ, wherein I fixed a single bug; namely, loading a category without the trailing `/` was causing an erroneous redirect, due to an apparent change in the depths of Flask.

This is one of those things where I really need to refactor Publ to make it properly unit-testable, gosh darnit.
