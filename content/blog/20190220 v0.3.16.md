Just another minor release of Publ! Mostly bugfixes. Here's what's new:

* Fixed an issue with HTML `<img>` rewriting with non-lowercase attribute names
* Fixed a bug with missing entries causing Publ to die when it tried to remove them from the index
* Added [`category.root`](170#root)
* Some code cleanups, especially removing some unneeded backwards compatibility shims for unsupported versions of Python
* [`Redirect-To`](322#redirect-to) will now resolve link targets

Relatedly to `category.root`, I'd neglected to add [`category.breadcrumb`](170#breadcrumb) to the manual when that functionality went in, and I've also added some usage examples, including something useful for fancy navigation bars.
