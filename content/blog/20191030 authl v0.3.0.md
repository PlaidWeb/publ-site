I just released Authl v0.3.0; minor version bump because of a public API change,
to better facilitate stateless storage.

Which is to say I converted most of the handlers to be stateless, which
hopefully fixes the issues with running on Heroku.

Unfortunately Twitter couldn't be fixed easily but I wasn't running the Twitter
handler on this site anyway. I do have some ideas but they're fairly involved
and will have to come later, and not when I'm up way past my bedtime.

Also, there still seems to be some cache-related issue that's making it
necessary to shift-reload the page after logging in or out, sometimes.
