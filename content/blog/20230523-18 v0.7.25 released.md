What's this, another Publ release? Why, yes! While [revamping my personal website](https://beesbuzz.biz/blog/5391-A-fresh-coat-of-paint) I came across some additional things that needed some Publ fixes to really work well.

The changes since 0.7.24 are:

* Consider whitespace-only entry parts (`entry.body` and `entry.more`) to be `False`
* Enable cache-control on templates which aren't user-dependent (such as stylesheets), hopefully cutting down on [FOUC issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content)
* Enable an appropriate same-site cookie policy for 2023
