Title: Update to v0.2.0
Date: 2018-07-06 15:57:57-07:00
Entry-ID: 92
UUID: 34dc69ed-999d-5dfa-8d33-8441bd5bf175

Only one change since v0.1.24, in that entry IDs and UUIDs are now semi-stably generated, in order to prevent problems like [the last time](23).

Publ itself is stable enough (and enough has changed since v0.1.0) that I felt that a minor version bump was a reasonable thing to do.

Anyway! While Publ has been running quite nicely on [my website](https://beesbuzz.biz/), I'd love to see more people actively using and developing it. This site in particular needs a lot of attention and probably reworking; my other [top priorities](https://github.com/fluffy-critter/Publ/issues) are:

* A better installation/deployment guide
* Proper test coverage (rather than manual smoke tests)
