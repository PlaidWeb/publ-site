I got an itch today to do a bunch of feature work, and also found and fixed a bunch of bugs that I didn't catch before.

Changes for this release:

* Fixed a bunch of tests which broke when I reorganized the test repository
* `prefix_` attributes now apply correctly to image and imageset `style` and `class` attributes
* Entries with empty slug-text now omit the slug-text separator from their permalink URL
* Markdown entries now support link rewriting for `href` and `src` attributes (so for example `<audio src="local_file.mp3">` will now work)
* Major bug fixes to the HTML renderer, which was dropping all entities, character references, and comments (oops)
* Disabled automatic smartquoting in HTML entries

.....

So for example, <a href="catpics/DSC07661.jpg">this image link</a> was written using HTML, even though this is a Markdown entry.

```markdown
So for example, <a href="catpics/DSC07661.jpg">this image link</a> was written using HTML, even though this is a Markdown entry.
```

And this applies to all HTML elements with `href` or `src` attributes; `<script>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` are all supported in both Markdown and HTML entries!
