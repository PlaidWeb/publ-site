Oh, it's been a little while since I've posted an update, hasn't it? That's
because I've been very busy building the templates for my personal site! In
doing so I've greatly improved the way that view refinements worked, fixed a few
silly bugs with image search paths on templates, and also added an easier way to
specify background images in CSS, via the `image().get_css_background()` method.

I'm really excited to be able to bring my first fully-realized Publ site to the
public; I hope it gets other people interested in what a flexible publishing
system allows them to do!
