Version 0.7.10 of Publ has been released. Not much different from 0.7.9:

* Force an update of Pygments to remove a temporary backwards-compatibility hack
* Add proper support for WebP image compression (as seen in the [image rendition options](335#file-formats))
* Make the installations of `whoosh` and `authl` optional, to cut down on installation bloat for sites that don't need them

The dependency changes have the potential for breaking functionality in existing sites. In order to restore full-text search and federated authentication, you'll need to add `whoosh` and `authl` to your deployment options, respectively. If you're using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or another dependency manager which understands extras, you can specify the `search` and `auth` extras in your `pyproject.toml`; for example:

```ini
!pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
gunicorn = "^20.0.4"
publ = {version = "^0.7.9", extras = ["search","auth"]}
pushl = "^0.3.3"
python-memcached = "^1.59"
```

Hopefully this is a helpful change for some people, and not too annoying for others.
