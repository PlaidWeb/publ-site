There is only one feature for this new release of Publ, but it's a big one -- there is (theoretical) support for [AutoAuth](https://indieweb.org/AutoAuth)! That's right, deploy this version and people should be able to magically log on to your website using unattended IndieAuth providers.

Unfortunately, there aren't any tools that I know of which actually support this mode of operation; all testing has been manual and In Theory.

Fortunately, if someone does want to test AutoAuth (or IndieAuth Bearer authentication in general), you can test it out on this site! You can use [this entry](20191029 secret.md) as an individual entry, and [this category](/blog/?date=201910) or [this feed](/blog/feed?date=201910) to see how well it works with the "partial public" path.

Also, [this page](/userinfo) will tell you all sorts of useful information about the current user (if any).

And I'd might as well use this opportunity to show off the [admin dashboard](/_admin) -- just sign in as the user `test:admin` to see how it looks.

==EDIT:== It looks like [there's a problem with third-party auth](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Authl/issues/43) due to the way that Heroku works. I should have anticipated this. Third-party auth is temporarily disabled for now. (But this doesn't affect `AutoAuth` at least!)
