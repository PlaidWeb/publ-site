Not a whole lot new in this one, because I haven't had time to work on Publ lately.

This release is mostly to fix a silly bug that was causing apostrophes and quotes to get dropped from plaintext renditions of titles and whatnot, which was caused by some of the refactoring I did in the run up to the 0.4.0 release and didn't notice until just now.

I also fixed a MathJax test, and did a bunch of refactoring/cleanup of one of the internal API shims. Nothing user-facing.

Oh! And I'll be attending [IndieWeb Summit 2019](https://2019.indieweb.org/summit) in Portland at the end of the month. I look forward to meeting other IndieWeb wonks! I love that RSVPing to it got me to finally [fix my site template's RSVP function](http://beesbuzz.biz/blog/8519-IndieWeb-Summit-2019).

And in other news I've finally been cleaning up the [quickstart guide](328) thanks to some feedback from a potential user. If you've been wanting to try Publ but were entirely confused or lost or whatever, please give it another look! And of course I am happy to get documentation feedback (or pull requests!) on the [site repository](/github-site).
