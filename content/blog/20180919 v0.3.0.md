Title: v0.3.0 released

Version 0.3.0 is now released, with the change from peewee to PonyORM.

As a result of this change you'll have to do two things to your config file:

1. The database configuration format has changed slightly

2. Any existing databases have to be manually deleted/dropped/etc.; unfortunately PonyORM doesn't provide a mechanism for deleting tables not under its control

Everything else should work identically as before.
