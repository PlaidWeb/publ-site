Publ v0.6.7 is out now. Various changes:

* Now using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for the build system
* Cleaned up some `Redirect-Url` logic to cut down on the number of page load hops
* Renamed the main branch to `main`[^motor memory]
* Bail out on files which repeatedly fail indexer fixups
* Default entry title and slug are now blank, rather than trying to guess from the filename
* Officially deprecated Python 3.5 support, which hasn't worked for quite some time anyway
* Defer Authl loading, and other Authl-related changes to support the latest version
* Add support for [line-numbering and captions in code blocks](322#fenced-code)

[^motor memory]: My motor memory is still adjusting.

I'm already regretting some of the decisions I made with the fenced code amendments; in the future it will almost certainly switch to using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`, and change some of the other structural bits. Feel free to [share your opinions](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/issues/399).

There's also a known issue where the quick-login link (for e.g. Twitter) doesn't work on pages which are login-required; this is actually an issue with the Authl login template, and has [already been fixed in Authl](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Authl/commit/66e10e1bd3f661d5a4fc9e4b554cb6462d8019a9) pending the next release.

And speaking of Authl, the [online docs](https://authl.readthedocs.io/) are way better now. Hopefully it's finally in a state where other people will be able to use it!
