[webmention.js](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js/) now supports changing the sort criterion and order of responses, and defaults to publication (rather than receipt) time.

This was mostly to improve the presentation of responses received via [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/), particularly from Twitter.
