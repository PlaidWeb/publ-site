I wrote more about this on [my personal blog](http://beesbuzz.biz/6715) but to summarize, I finally made some progress on actually working on Authl, which was the missing piece I needed before finally getting started on [private posts](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/issues/147). No promises on when I'll actually have that functionality working, but at least I've finally gotten over the chicken-and-egg bump of not having any auth system to implement privacy against (and no privacy system to implement auth for).

Anyway, if anyone wants to play with what I have so far, there's an incredibly basic starting point [over yonder](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Authl).
