Title: Publ v0.5.6 released
Tag: release

Oops, I'd been sitting on a bunch of bugfixes for a month, which I didn't notice until I put in another bugfix tonight.

Changes since v0.5.5:

* Fix title sanitization
* Handle category.name with the same formatting options as entry.title
* Replace hand-rolled atomic file operations with [atomicwrites](https://pypi.org/project/atomicwrites/)
* Add [`link_class`](335#link_class) to image renditions
* Fix automatic `alt` generation for external images
* Simplify the way entry URLs are canonicized
* Fix some bitrot in older tests
