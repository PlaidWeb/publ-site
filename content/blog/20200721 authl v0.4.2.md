Authl v0.4.2 is out. Mostly infrastructural changes, but a few other changes too:

* Switched the development environment to [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
* Made some internal naming changes, and renamed the technically-incorrect `force_ssl` to the more-accurate `force_https`
* It is also now up to handlers to do all of their own exception catching, which cleans up some stuff
* Massively overhauled the docs, and got doc site generation working with [Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org) (many thanks to [Khr](https://scalie.business/@chr/) for help!)

In theory there will now be docs visible at [authl.readthedocs.io](https://authl.readthedocs.io/), although I'm still having trouble getting some of it to actually appear.

But, speaking of appearing, somehow the hostname for this site stopped resolving, so hopefully by the time this site comes back, the readthedocs stuff will be working too!
