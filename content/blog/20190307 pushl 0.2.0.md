So, I just released v0.2.0 of [Pushl](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl). It was a [pretty big change](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Pushl/compare/v0.1.8..v0.2.0), in that I pretty much rewrote all the networking stuff, and fixed some pretty ridiculous bugs with the caching implementation as well.

The main thing is now it's using async I/O instead of thread-per-connection, so it's way more efficient and also times out correctly.

And oh gosh, I had so many tiny but critical errors in the way caching was implemented -- no *wonder* it kept on acting as if there was no cached state. Yeesh.

Anyway, I'll let this run on my site for a few days and if I like what I see I'll upgrade it to beta status on PyPI.
