Happy solstice! I seem to be finding lots of stuff to fix and improve these days. Huh.

Changes since v0.3.12:

* Fixed a [date display issue](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/issues/145) on databases other than SQLite
* Fixed an issue where markup was being emitted in the `<og:title>` element for OpenGraph cards
* Fixed a bug which prevented entry files from being moved (a side-effect of the Windows compatibility fixes)
* Added the ability to [override title sort](322#sort-title)
* Also added the ability to use anchors on [resolved entry links](322#entry-links)
