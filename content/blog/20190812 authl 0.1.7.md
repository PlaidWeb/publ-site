I've released Authl v0.1.7, which now adds direct support for IndieAuth (rather than requiring [IndieLogin.com](https://indielogin.com) as a broker). This means that now folks who have an IndieAuth identity can log in using that; previously I was expecting IndieLogin.com to eventually open up client registrations to make that a useful authentication path, but for various reasons Aaron hasn't opened it up to the general public.

Part of this update was to also refactor how OAuth is handled, so it'll be a lot easier for me to add more OAuth-based providers in the future; hopefully I'll have direct support for Twitter, GitHub, and maybe even Facebook in the near-ish future. But for now, between Mastodon, email, and IndieAuth, I think I have all of my own personal needs taken care of.

Feel free to make suggestions for other identity providers in the [Authl issue tracker](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Authl/issues), though!
