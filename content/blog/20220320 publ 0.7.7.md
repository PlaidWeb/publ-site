It's been a hot minute since I've worked on any Publ stuff, but v0.7.7 is now released. The following changes have been made since then:

* TicketAuth: added support for the [provisional request flow](https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/87) and for [refresh tokens](https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/81)
* Also added an optional scope parameter to the TicketAuth request (which Publ itself doesn't use and it doesn't make much sense in a TicketAuth context but maybe someone will have a use for it)
* Added the ability to specify absolute links on the [login](324#login_link) and [logout](324#logout_link) template functions
* Allow [disabling the index watchdog](865#index_enable_watchdog)
* Properly strip tables from auto-generated entry summaries
