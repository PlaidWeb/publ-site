Oh wow, I finally closed out the [Publ 0.4.0 milestone](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/milestone/2). So, wow, this is a pretty big deal for me.

Changes since 0.3.23:

* Fixed a bug with [absolute paths in asset links](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/pull/202)
* Added a [default error handler](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/pull/203) if there's no global error template configured
* Finally added the ability to [configure the Markdown processor](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/pull/204), both at the global and per-template level

So that closes out the last three issues before I was ready to consider this usable by a wider audience. Neat.

There's [a lot of stuff I want to do for 1.0](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/Publ/milestone/3) of course, but also more importantly I need to vastly improve the documentation on this site, as well as collect things to make it easier for people to get started with Publ. I would absolutely invite people to make suggestions; have you looked into Publ, and been confused about what exactly to do? Please let me know!

The best ways to do so are to either hop onto [my Discord channel](https://beesbuzz.biz/discord) or to open issues against [the documentation site](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/publ-site/issues).

.....

Also, Publ itself is built to be a tool, and not a complete standalone thing. I will absolutely talk your ear off about how I think a more user-friendly publishing frontend could be built, as well as easier ways of actually installing/deploying this places.

One of the things I am considering doing is running some minimal Publ-oriented hosting for folks, where I'd set up a private git repository and a minimal site and make it hopefully easier for people to actually do their thing, and maybe charge a marginal amount for it (say, $X/month for X GB of storage, and include SSL and basic site assistance and whatever). If you'd be interested in that sort of thing, again, please let me know!
