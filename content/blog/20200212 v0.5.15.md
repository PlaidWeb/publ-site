Not much to say about this, just a handful of performance tweaks and bug fixes:

* Improved caching behavior around URL parameters
* Allow configuring the [maximum image render threads](865#image_render_threads)
* Fixed an exception when trying to extract an OpenGraph card from an empty entry
* Improve entry ID conflict reconciliation
* Force absolute image URLs in OpenGraph tags
