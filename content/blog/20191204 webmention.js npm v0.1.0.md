Due to popular demand, there is now an [NPM package for webmention.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webmention.js). So, if you use npm as part of your site JavaScript workflow, now you can theoretically use this.

Thanks to [Andr√© Jaenisch](https://github.com/Ryuno-Ki) for his incredibly generous help in getting this set up!

And, if you run into any trouble (or have any suggestions for improvement), please [open an issue](https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js/issues).

(Full disclosure: I have even more of no idea what I'm doing than usual.)
