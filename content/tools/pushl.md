Pushl is a tool which adds [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) integration in the form of [WebSub](https://indieweb.org/WebSub), [Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention), and [pingback](https://indieweb.org/pingback) into any website that provides an RSS or Atom feed.

It was written as a companion to Publ but it works with any site generator such as Movable Type, Jekyll/Octopress, Pelican, and so on, as well as many modern forums such as phpBB and XenForo.
